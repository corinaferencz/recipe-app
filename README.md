## 📝 About The Project
Since I enjoy cooking for my hubby and our guests, I chose to build this app to make the process smoother and have my favourite recipes at hand. 

Of course, let’s not forget about our cat (Salty 🐱) who is popping up from behind the table and is slamming his paw on it, while I am chopping the ingredients. He was also an excellent companion, purring, while I was building this app.
